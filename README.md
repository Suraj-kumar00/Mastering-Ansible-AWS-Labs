## What is Ansible?

> Ansible is an IT automation tool like systems, cloud, networking and automating all the things.

> It's an `open-source` automation tool used for `configuration management`, `application deployment`, `orchestration`, and `task automation`.

> It's agentless (uses SSH for linux/Unix & WinRM for windows) and utilizes `YAML` to define `playbooks` making it human readable & easy to write.
